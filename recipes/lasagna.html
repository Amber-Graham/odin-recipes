        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable broth, or as needed</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
